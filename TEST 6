Is 8.4×10²⁸ J/year enough to move tectonic and subduction plates in one year?

To answer this question, we need to first assess whether the energy produced at a rate of 8.4 × 10²⁸ J/year is sufficient to cause tectonic plate movement, particularly the kind of rapid plate movement 
described in the Catastrophic Plate Tectonics (CPT) model, where the continents move apart during a global flood event.

Key Considerations

Energy Requirements for Plate Tectonics Plate tectonics is driven primarily by heat flow from the Earth's interior, which is responsible for mantle convection, subduction, and other tectonic processes. 
The energy required for moving plates depends on various factors such as:

The frictional forces resisting plate motion (e.g., between the subducting plate and the mantle).

The viscosity of the mantle, which affects how easily material can flow and thus how plates move.

The velocity of the plate movement.

The density and temperature differences between the lithosphere and the mantle.

Current Energy Supply for Plate Tectonics According to geological studies, the current rate of heat flow from the Earth's interior, which drives mantle convection and tectonic movement, is estimated to be 
around 44 terawatts (44 × 10¹² W). This heat is generated by several mechanisms, including:

Radiogenic heating from the decay of isotopes like uranium and thorium.

Gravitational potential energy due to the Earth’s formation and the cooling of the mantle.

This energy is spread over the entire mantle, and its primary role is to drive the slow motion of tectonic plates over millions of years. For context:

Plate motion speed: Plate speeds are typically between 2 to 10 cm/year (i.e., very slow in geological terms).

Energy required for plate movement: To get an idea of how much energy is required to move plates, we can look at the amount of energy needed to overcome friction and force the plates to move. According to estimates, 
the energy required for plate tectonics is in the range of 10¹² to 10¹⁴ watts (1 to 100 terawatts).

3. Comparison of Heat Generated and Required Energy

Let’s now compare the energy produced by 8.4 × 10²⁸ J/year to the energy needed for tectonic movement:

Energy Produced in One Year

The energy produced in one year by nuclear decay in the HAD 2.0 model is: 8.4x10^28 J/year

This is equivalent to: 8.4x10^28 J/year ÷ 31,536,000seconds/year ≈ 2.66×10^28 W J/year

So, this corresponds to about 2.66 × 10²¹ watts of power generated throughout the year.

Energy Required for Tectonic Movement

As noted earlier, the energy required for tectonic processes is on the order of 10¹² to 10¹⁴ watts. The total energy required for tectonic plate movement depends on the specific forces acting on the plates, but we can use these 
rough estimates to compare against the energy available in the HAD 2.0 model.

Conclusion

When we compare the energy produced by the HAD 2.0 model (2.66 × 10²¹ W) to the energy required for tectonic processes (on the order of 10¹² to 10¹⁴ W), it becomes clear that 8.4 × 10²⁸ J/year is orders of magnitude greater 
than the energy required to move tectonic plates.

The HAD model's heat production is approximately 1,000 to 10,000 times greater than the total energy needed to drive plate tectonics. This means the energy is more than sufficient to accelerate plate motion and initiate 
catastrophic tectonic movements such as those described in the CPT model, where continents would move apart rapidly.

Is 8.4 × 10²⁸ J/year enough heat to move tectonic plates apart in just one year?

Yes, 8.4 × 10²⁸ J/year is more than enough to generate the necessary heat to drive rapid plate tectonics, including the splitting of continents, in just one year. The amount of energy generated far exceeds the energy 
typically required for the gradual, long-term movement of tectonic plates, making rapid tectonic movement feasible in the context of the HAD 2.0 model.
